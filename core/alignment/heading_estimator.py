"""
Heading (yaw) alignment estimator using GNSS velocity and vehicle dynamics.

Estimates the phone's heading offset relative to the vehicle frame using:
1. GNSS-derived vehicle velocity direction (when sufficient speed)
2. Longitudinal/forward acceleration patterns
3. Lateral acceleration during turns (as a secondary indicator)

Magnetometer is used only as a weak aiding source to avoid reliance on
distortion-prone compass readings, per requirements.

Outputs a heading offset estimate and confidence.
