## Validated Core Capabilities (Phases 1–7)
- **Sensor Types & Synchronization**: Immutable dataclasses (`ImuSample`, `MagSample`, `GnssFix`, `BaroSample`), linear and spherical linear (`slerp`) quaternion interpolation, CSV/Binary logger and replay iterator.
- **IMU Bias Calibration**: Multi-position static bias estimation decoupling arbitrary 3D gravity vectors from sensor biases.
- **Magnetometer Calibration**: SVD-based least-squares ellipsoid fitting extracting hard-iron bias and soft-iron shape matrices.
- **Phone-Vehicle Alignment**: Phone-to-vehicle alignment engine tracking `GRAVITY_ONLY` tilt via accelerometer, and `FULLY_ALIGNED` yaw via GNSS velocity and Magnetometer aiding. Detects relative movement with rigid thresholding.
- **Mechanization Sub-system**: Deterministic Euler-integrated dead reckoning step translating raw IMU events into smooth Pos/Vel/Attitude NavState traces in Local Tangent Plane (NED).
- **ESKF Architecture**: 15-state Error-State Kalman Filter mapping Position, Velocity, Attitude, and 6-DOF Biases. Mathematically tracks deterministic states with continuous-discrete Jacobians, covariance PSD maintenance via Joseph form, outlier Mahalanobis gating, and direct analytical bias convergence.
- **ZUPT Detector**: Soft probabilistic stationary detection P(stat) ∈ [0,1] with adaptive covariance scaling R_zupt = R_base / (P_stat^γ + ε). Exponential soft thresholding based on accelerometer/gyroscope variance and temporal consistency smoothing.
- **ML Velocity Estimator**: Lightweight 1D CNN architecture accepting 6-channel IMU windows, outputting forward velocity prediction and log-variance for uncertainty quantification. Integration with ESKF via `update_forward_velocity()` with proper vehicle-to-navigation frame Jacobian.
- **Regression Suite**: 116/116 tests passing under Python 3.14 and NumPy 2.5.3 with zero external mathematical instability dependencies.
